# Building Websites at Ideas On Purpose

This repository introduces some of IOP's preferred tools and workflows.

ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; Hello team! You all have full access to this repository so please feel free to add, edit or embellish anything here. Git is the glue that holds it all together and a terrific safety net. Go crazy, we can always roll back!

This project repository is divided into four sections, each with a matching directory. Each contains a readme with additional detail specific to that section.

Those readme files are written using _Markdown_, a super-simple, text-based markup language that converts to HTML. Markdown has become a common baseline for writing styled documents in a technical context. Itâ€™s very easy to learn and the styling conventions and syntax result in documents which are highly readable even as plain text.

* [Learn Markdown In 60 Seconds](http://commonmark.org/help/)
